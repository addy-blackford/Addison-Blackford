        <h1> About Me :)</h1>
        <p> I'm going into 11<sup>th</sup> grade at Boonville High School. I really only discovered my love for computers about a year ago. I've always been interested in the way things work and I love being able to create something that shows my abilities. </p>
        <h1> My Hobbies </h1>
        <p> Honestly, I'm a bit of a jock. I love playing sports, even if I hate watching them. I've been involved in soccer since I could walk and got into tennis a few years ago. Now, I'm the varsity goalie and play tennis as a stress reliever.   </p>
        
        <p> I also play music and you can find videos of me playing under "My Music". Primarily, I play bass, but I started by playing ukelele. I've even tried out a bit of guitar in 2021, but I couldn't feel a connection to the instrument. As of September of 2021, I've been playing bass for the <a href="https://ema.mymusicstaff.com/">Evansville Music Academy</a>'s Rock Band.  </p>
